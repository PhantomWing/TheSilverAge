# The Silver Age - `version/1.21.3`

**This file describes the `version/1.21.3` line**: Minecraft 1.21.3 (the jar covers 1.21.2 and 1.21.3), Fabric and NeoForge.
Built with Architectury Loom (`dev.architectury.loom`) with Mojang mappings layered with Parchment; `remapJar` is the shipped jar.

It belongs to whichever folder has this branch checked out - the main `TheSilverAge` folder or a worktree
under `TheSilverAge/.worktrees/`. A session started in a worktree also loads the main folder's CLAUDE.md,
which describes another line; for this folder, this file is the one that applies. Confirm with
`git branch --show-current`. `MinecraftDeveloperPortal/data/mods.json` lists every line of the mod.

Vanilla-friendly mod adding oxidizable silver content. Mod ID `thesilverage`, package
`com.phantomwing.thesilverage`. `TheSilverAge-Wiki` in the workspace root is its GitHub wiki.

Every `version/*` line is Architectury. `neoforge/1.21` and `forge/1.20` are single-loader
leftovers from before the split, not lines. A root `src/` folder may linger on disk from that
layout; nothing in it is tracked or built.

## Layout

```
common/src/main/java/com/phantomwing/thesilverage/   loader-agnostic code
fabric/   ... /fabric/ + /platform/                  Fabric entry point and platform implementations
neoforge/ ... /neoforge/ + /platform/                NeoForge entry point and platform implementations
```

`platform/` is the Architectury expect/actual boundary: the interface lives in `common`, each loader
supplies its own implementation. Anything loader-specific goes there rather than behind a runtime
check.

## Domain conventions

- **Weathering/oxidation** - silver blocks follow the copper pattern: `UNAFFECTED → EXPOSED →
  WEATHERED → OXIDIZED`, each with a normal and a waxed variant. Registered through generic helpers
  in `ModBlocks`; the state mappings live in `ModOxidizables` and `ModWaxables`. Adding a silver
  block usually means touching all three.
- **Creative tab** - `ModItems.CREATIVE_TAB_ITEMS` is a `LinkedHashSet`, so insertion order *is* tab
  order. Items are added by the registration helpers, not by hand.
- **Tags** - `ModTags` for the mod namespace, `CommonTags` for `c:`. Silver interoperates with other
  mods almost entirely through `c:ingots/silver` and friends; keep new materials tagged there.
- **Config** - options that change recipes or loot are emitted by datagen wrapped in a condition, so
  the condition lands in the JSON rather than in a runtime branch.

JEI, AppleSkin and Jade are runtime-only dev dependencies, not compiled against. They are free to drop
on a rung where they have no build; that does not block the line.

## This line

- Java 21, Mojang mappings with Parchment. `org.gradle.java.home` is pinned in `gradle.properties` to a JDK on this machine; if the daemon fails to start, check that path first.
- Datagen: `:neoforge:runData`. Output: `common/src/generated/resources`, never hand-edited.
- No game tests yet. Writing the first one for whatever is ported next is the highest-value test available (`verification.md`).
- Published with `publishMods` from `fabric/build.gradle` and `neoforge/build.gradle`, with the `-PpublishDryRun` flag. Uploads are tagged from `supported_minecraft_versions`.
- Hand-authored access wideners and transformers: `common/src/main/resources/thesilverage.accesswidener` and `neoforge/src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg`. A first suspect when a port fails to load.
